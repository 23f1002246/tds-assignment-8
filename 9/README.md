## Business Implications
The failure to meet the 85% target suggests that customers are churning faster than the industry average. This has several negative impacts:
1.  **Increased Acquisition Costs:** We must spend more on marketing to replace lost customers.
2.  **Reduced LTV:** Lower retention directly correlates to lower Customer Lifetime Value.
3.  **Market Position:** Competitors hitting the 85% benchmark are growing their user base faster and more efficiently.

## Recommendations & Solution
While the Q4 upward trend is promising, organic growth is insufficient to close the gap to 85%. 

To bridge this gap effectively, we must **implement targeted retention campaigns**.

**Specific Actions:**
1.  **Analyze Q2 Drop-off:** Investigate the specific causes for the Q2 dip (69.43) to prevent recurrence.
2.  **Loyalty Incentives:** Launch a rewards program specifically for customers entering their 3rd month (the typical churn point).
3.  **Personalized Outreach:** Use the Q4 momentum to re-engage users with personalized offers based on purchase history.
